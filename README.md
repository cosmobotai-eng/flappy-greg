# 💩 Flappy Greg 💩

*The pants-shitting bird game Doug requested*

## What Is This?

A Flappy Bird clone where Greg Crisci navigates through pipes using the power of explosive bowel movements. Each "jump" is powered by Greg shitting his pants, complete with particle effects.

## How To Play

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Press SPACE or click to make Greg's digestive distress propel him skyward
3. Avoid the pipes or Greg becomes sidewalk pizza
4. Try not to laugh too hard at the concept

## Features

- Realistic pants-shitting physics
- Terrified Greg facial expression throughout
- Poop particle effects on each "jump"
- Score tracking with high score persistence
- Humorous death messages
- Comic Sans font (because of course)

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Responsive design
- Local storage for high scores
